PROMPT:
Wolverine is on a mission to find the legendary Diamond Wolverine Coin, rumored to possess mystical powers. 
He feels a personal obligation to locate the diamond and harness its power to aid his ongoing fight against evil 
and to visit the Wolverine Store. 
Mr. Remillard, a respected headmaster at the Westview School for Gifted Coders, is the only one who knows the truth - 
he has hidden the diamond coin deep within a treacherous maze in Torrey Pines State Reserve.
Wolverine seeks guidance from you, who has warned him of the dangers he will face and offers him tips on how to navigate the maze. 
Wolverine trusts you and will set out on his journey, prepared for the challenges that lie ahead. As Wolverine delves deeper into the maze, 
he relies on his heightened senses and sharp claws to avoid the many traps and obstacles that he encounters. With your guidance echoing in his mind, 
he makes his way closer to the Diamond Wolverine Buck.

STUDENT OBJECTIVE(S):
- work with the java stack and queue data structures
- work with classes and 2D/3D arrays
- implement a provided algorithm per spec in java
- develop test cases for testing code
- work with file i/o 
- develop a solution to a programming challenge/problem in java

===================================================================================================

FINISHED ITEMS:
1. Read the specifications - understand the problem
2. Understand map-based input files
3. Add I/O functionality (reading a maze and storing its values in an object, then printing it out to a seperate file)
4. Add exceptions (IllegalCommandLineInputsException, IllegalMapCharacterException, IncompleteMapException, IncorrectMapFormatException)
5. Find places to throw exceptions
6. Work on measuring and reporting runtime for the entire search algorithm
7. Start working on a PathFinder class that takes in Maze objects and returns a 3D char array with the solution path
8. Implement the Stack based approach to the PathFinder class
9. Implement the Queue based approach to the PathFinder class
10. Implement the optimal approach to the PathFinder class

IN-PROGRESS:
- Modify the Maze class to support the output formats of the solution path

TO-DO LIST (in order of priority):
- Add support for commandline arguments and finish writing the help message
- Write tests using JUnit to check if the program's solutions are correct and search for bugs
- Add support for searching multiple Wolverine Bucks
- Optimize the runtime of all three search algorithms
- Document all my code
